# Demo Provider: [short-io](https://short.io)

This repo holds the result of a [livestream](https://youtu.be/ONbo1ru8tUA) with
[@rawkode](https://github.com/rawkode) and I ([@iwahbe](https://github.com/iwahbe)),
showing off the [pulumi-go-provider](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-go-provider) SDK.

After the livestream was over, I checked in what we had, then did some code cleanup to get
it working.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out in the Pulumi Community slack, or with
an issue on this repo.
